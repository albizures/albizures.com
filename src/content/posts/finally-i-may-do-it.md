After so many attempts to write posts for my personal blog on a regular basis. Finally, I may do it.

## What's different this time?
Probably nothing. But, like every attempt (if we can call it that üòÖ) before this one, I have the hope that this time will be different. And I kept telling myself "this time is different" yet I do nothing. Yet, here I am again, trying to write a post for my personal blog.

## Some differences though
There are some differences though. I have been trying to cut down my internet consumption, which I hope will give me more time to write and think things through.

And apart from that, I've changed my approach towards my personal projects. Yes I'm trying to be more consistent and not to give up easily just because my interests suddenly changed but embrace the fact that I easily get distracted or bored, often jumping from one project to another. This means I'm trying to be more organized and have a plan for my projects, so I can come back to them whenever I want to. This approach has allowed me to make some progress overall.

## What's next?
I'm planning to write mostly about things I just learned or understood, like when I finally understand how a certain technology works or when I finally get a concept that I've been struggling with. But also about my personal projects, like the ideas behind them, the technologies I'm using, the problems I'm facing and how I'm solving them or any update on them. I'm also planning to write about my thoughts on different topics, just like this post.

I'm not planning though to have a schedule for my posts, I'll just write whenever I feel like it. So I may write a post every other week or at least once a month. Who knows? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
