After so many attempts to write posts for my personal blog on a regular basis. Finally, I may do it.

## What's different this time?
Probably nothing. But, like every time before this one, I have the hope that this time will be different. And I told myself "this time is different" and then did nothing. Yet, here I am again, trying to write a post for my personal blog.

## Some differences though
There are some differences though. I have been trying to cut down my internet consumption, which I hope will give me more time to write and think things through. And apart from that, I've changed my approach towards my personal projects. Yes I'm trying to be more consistent and not to give up easily but embracing the fact that I distract myself easily or get bored and I end up jumping from one project to another which has allowed me to make some progress overall.

## What's next?
I'm planning to write mostly about my personal projects, like the ideas behind them, the technologies I'm using, the problems I'm facing and how I'm solving them or any update on them. I'm also planning to write about my thoughts on different topics, just like this post.
